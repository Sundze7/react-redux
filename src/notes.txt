the map fxn creates a new array from calling a function for every array element
Prop Drilling -> can only pass props down in React - from parent to child. Can do otherwise using redux, external libraries

npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux 

The redux-toolkit consists of of some libraries like..
> redux (core lib, state managment)
> immer (allows to mutate state)
> redux-thunk (handle async actions)
> reselect (simplifies reducer functions)

> redux is not specific to react; it can be used with diff't frontend frameworks

> Provider is the lib that connects redux store to our app - reason why we wrap it around our app
